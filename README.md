# Multiplayer Tetris in TypeScript
Classic Tetris game written in HTML5, JS, with multiplayer support over Web Sockets

# How to use
Run `npm start` for production version

Run `npm run start:dev` for development version. Please note that this command uses `npm-run-all` to execute parallel watch commands for both server and client. While Client runs on port 9000, it is better to use the client version served with Express on port 3000.
